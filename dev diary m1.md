## Vanja Venezia - Milestone #1 Dev Diary

I'm coming into this project feeling relatively confident. The ball roller game was my first time using Unity or C# so I was a bit nervous about how it would go. However, upon completing that tutorial, I realized how similar Unity is to YoyoGames Game Maker and Game Maker Studio, which I took classes in as a kid and grew up making simple games in. The aspects that are different are pretty similar to Maya, which I learned in high school, so overall the featureset will take some getting used to and practice of course, but feels quite familiar which is relieving!

I just started the card game tutorial and realized I should probably start the dev diary so I could follow along and write as I go through the project.
